This project demonstrates a simple brute-force attack simulation on a login system built using Python, HTML, CSS, and a password wordlist. It includes a web-based login interface and a Python script that attempts to brute-force the login credentials using a wordlist of passwords.

### Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to simulate how brute-force attacks function and show the importance of securing login systems. The Python script (brute_force.py) automates login attempts by trying different passwords from a wordlist until the correct one is found. The project also contains a basic web interface where a user can input login details.
